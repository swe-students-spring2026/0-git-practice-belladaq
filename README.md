# My thoughts 

This article discusses the growing emphasis on overall systems knowledge rather than programming fluency in the wake of LLMs as coding tools. I found it interesting that it mentions the widening gap between what computer science students are taught in general coursework versus what they are expected to know and apply in their actual entry level roles. The article emphasizes that the preparation needed for a career in software is shifting and students entering the workforce need to understand underlying system architecture early on. Especially in the current market, identifying what systems are safe and productive are key decisions that AI can't make.

# Response from Hudhaifah Rehman
I find this interesting, I had a similar realization in reading my article. I definitely think we're at a point where we need to learn things beyond the description of our roles to be able to properly contribute in the workforce. I think we need to understand a lot more about how to ask the right questions to AI and how to properly apply it to our work.
