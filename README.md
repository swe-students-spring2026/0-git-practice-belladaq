# My thoughts 

This article discusses the growing emphasis on overall systems knowledge rather than programming fluency in the wake of LLMs as coding tools. I found it interesting that it mentions the widening gap between what computer science students are taught in general coursework versus what they are expected to know and apply in their actual entry level roles. The article emphasizes that the preparation needed for a career in software is shifting and students entering the workforce need to understand underlying system architecture early on. Especially in the current market, identifying what systems are safe and productive are key decisions that AI can't make.
